# neural-activity-visualization
Scripts to visualize how brain cell activity is linked with mouse sleep-wake behavior

## Goal

Analyse nerve cell population recordings from mice and create figures that clearly show how nerve cell activity changes as mice transition between sleep-wake states.


## Process

Download repository and make sure scripts in **functions** folder are on your MATLAB path. Your data (see **examples** folder for example files to work with) should be in the working directory prior to running the below scripts.

### segmentData
For each mouse (data from each mouse is saved in a separate raw data file), this script opens the raw datafile and cleans the data to remove noise and drift. It then segments the data at transition points between sleep-wake states and saves this segmented data as a matrix in a new datafile in the 'results' folder (made by the script).

This script takes as its input **.mat** files containing structs for synchronized time-series information. This includes:
- neural activity (Calcium)
- background activity (Backgrou)
- what stage of sleep the mouse is currently in (instant_state)

### groupTransitions
This script opens the segmented data files generated by the segmentData script, averages the data over all mice and makes visualizations (heatmaps, average neural activity plots) of the grouped data.


## Requirements

MATLAB scripts written and validated using version R2017a
